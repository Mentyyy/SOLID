SOLID is not 100% about applying the rules. 

Because, as you'll see many times, you'll be forced to break them or it may turns out that the rules will conflict with each other. 

It makes you think differently about programming, you don't close yourself to the task you'll get, but you create applications as a whole thing. 

Only the knowledge of SOLID will allow you to consciously break the rules it defines!
