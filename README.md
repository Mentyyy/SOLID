SOLID is not 100% about applying the rules. 

Because, as you will see many times, you will be forced to break them or it may turn out that the rules will conflict with each other. 

It makes you think differently about programming, you don't close yourself to the task you will get, but you create applications as a whole thing. 

Only the knowledge of SOLID will allow you to consciously break the rules it defines!
