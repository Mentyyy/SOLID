/*
Rule: Many dedicated interfaces are better than one too general.
IOW: Interfaces should be specific and as small as possible. Don't create interface with unused methods.

    "In C++ programming there is no built-in concept of interfaces. In order to create an interface, 
     we need to create an abstract class which is having only pure virtual methods. 
     In C++, Interfaces are also called pure abstract classes."


The code below is incorrect because not every interface-defined method is used in derived classes.

If we look at the interfaces built into C#, we'll see that most of them implement one or two methods:
    IEquatable - 1 
    ICloneable - 1 
    IComparable - 1 
    IEnumerable - 1 
    IIterator - 2
